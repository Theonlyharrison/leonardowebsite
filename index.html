Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was an Italian polymath known for his extraordinary contributions to art, science, and engineering. Born in Vinci, Italy, he was a painter, sculptor, architect, inventor, and scientist, embodying the spirit of the Renaissance.
Da Vinci is most famous for his iconic paintings, "Mona Lisa" and "The Last Supper," both masterpieces that showcase his mastery of perspective, anatomy, and human emotion. His notebooks, filled with sketches and ideas, reveal his deep curiosity about the natural world. He studied anatomy, flight, hydraulics, and even conceptualized inventions such as a flying machine and a tank—centuries ahead of his time.
Despite producing only a few completed artworks, his impact on art and science remains unmatched. Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 in France, leaving behind a legacy of genius and innovation that continues to inspire the world today.
